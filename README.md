👋 Hey there! I'm **Shouryah Bali**, an aspiring electronics and telecommunication engineer with a growing passion for coding, problem-solving, and building real-world projects.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree from **Thadomal Shahani Engineering College**, affiliated with Mumbai University. While my core interests lie in electronics and telecom, I’ve developed a deep enthusiasm for programming—especially in **Python**, **C**, and **C++**.

💻 I believe in **learning by doing**, which is why I created this GitHub profile to document my journey, projects, and experiments. Whether it's automating simple tasks, building beginner Python apps, or working with microcontrollers like **Arduino**, I enjoy understanding the “how” and “why” behind everything.

🛠️ **Tech Stack I'm Exploring**:
- Python (beginner to intermediate projects)
- C / C++ (core logic building)
- HTML (basic web stuff)
- Arduino, sensors, and basic hardware tools
- Git & GitHub (version control, collaboration)
- Starting with tools like VS Code, Git Bash, and terminal workflows

🚀 **Goals**:
- Build strong fundamentals in both hardware and software
- Create meaningful open-source projects
- Contribute to tech communities and hackathons
- Eventually intern or work with companies like **Qualcomm**, **Texas Instruments**, or **Tata Communications**

📈 **Current Focus**:
- Completing Python courses (like the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu)
- Hosting mini projects here for practice and showcasing
- Preparing for future roles in tech by building a strong portfolio

🏀 Outside of tech, I'm a drummer, basketball player, and creative thinker — all of which fuel my problem-solving mindset.
